// HAND-CURATED WMATA station models — the curated tier the auto-generator
// (scripts/wmata-pathways.mts) deliberately can't produce. These stations sit
// in wmata-data/chains-excluded.json because their live-feed observations
// exceed or can't map onto the GTFS pathways topology (the observed-units
// gate), NOT because their structure is unclear — a human confirmed each one.
//
// Elevator externalIds here are REAL live-feed UnitNames wherever the unit has
// ever appeared in the Incidents feed (observed-units.json); a unit that has
// never broken since archiving began keeps its synthetic GTFS slot id
// (WMATA-<node>) until its real UnitName is first observed.
//
// Curated models must NOT overlap the generated set — a station is in one tier
// or the other (`check:wmata` asserts no station id appears in both).

  // Human-confirmed (Bryce, 2026-07-13): Rockville DOES have two elevators
  // between the pedestrian bridge and the mezzanine — they back each other up
  // on that leg. The mezzanine is at street grade (both GTFS entrances reach it
  // by walkway), so the core street→platform chain needs only the platform
  // elevator; the bridge is a separate secondary entrance over the tracks,
  // modeled as its own chain (same pattern as BART Warm Springs' bridge chain).
