# Roosevelt (41400) — outstanding question, posted to Discord 2026-07-16

Deferred in the station-review queue (`cta:41400`) pending firsthand answers.
Paste responses back to Claude in the `/liftwatch-station-review` session —
they'll be used to finalize the model in `src/catalog/cta-models.ts`.

## What we know for sure

- CTA's live alert feed has only ever named ONE elevator here: "the transfer
  tunnel elevator at Roosevelt (Red, Orange and Green Lines)" (id
  `41400-TRANSFER-TUNNEL`, first observed 2026-07-08).
- CTA's ASAP Strategic Plan (Tables 14/15, elevator replacement program) says
  Roosevelt has **3 elevators total**.
- chicago-L.org (third-party, not agency) describes only 2: a "main"
  street→mezzanine elevator plus the transfer tunnel elevator to the elevated
  (Orange/Green) — accounting for only 2 of the agency's 3.

Bryce got a full structural answer via Discord (2026-07-16):

Resolved: TWO independent chains, not one. Green/Orange = one elevator
straight to street. Red Line = two elevators in series (street→tunnel,
tunnel→platform). Bryce confirmed the real observed id
(`41400-TRANSFER-TUNNEL`) maps to the tunnel→platform leg — the shared
choke point for both Red riders arriving from street and Orange/Green
riders transferring down to the Red platform, which is why the live alert
text names all three lines. Modeled in `src/catalog/cta-models.ts`
